## Hi there! I'm Sky 💞️
I go by the screen name @itswex because... well.. I like it?

- 👋 I'm a 20 year old student of psychology with no right to learn how to program, but here I am giving it my best shot!
- 🌱 I'm interested in learning Minecraft Mod Development using the Fabric API
- 👀 I'm practicing using Java 16, and hoping to learn to develop resources for my mods in the future!
- 🎉My first day coding is July 24th, 2022!

> Please feel free to use my code in any way, shape, or form, so long as you provide credit to @itswex and do not profit off of it (though I doubt you'd be able to)

*I have no experience as a developer, certainly not with Java and absolutely NOT with resource design. I'm learning as I go, so bear with me!*
